```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## 2.4 Writing Your Own Functions

We have working R code that simulates rolling a pair of dice:

```{r}
die <- 1:6
dice <- sample(die, size = 2, replace=TRUE)
sum(dice)
```


```{r}

```

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
