A computer program is a sequence of commands and instructions to
effectively solve a given problem. Such a problem may involve
calculations, data processing, or both. Each computer program is
based on an underlying procedure called algorithm. An algorithm
may be implemented in different ways, leading to different
programs using the same procedure. We follow this convention
throughout this book, where an algorithm refers to a list of
procedures whereas a program refers to its implementation as a
code.
