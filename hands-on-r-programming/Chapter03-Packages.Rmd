## 3.1 Packages
- Package `qplot` berarti quick plot. 
- Berikut adalah fungsinya dan `qplot` is a long function

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
qplot
```

- If you give `qplot` two vectors of equal lengths, `qplot` will draw a scatterplot for you. 
- `qplot` will use the first vector as a set of x values and the second vector as a set of y values.
-  Until now, we've been creating sequences of numbers with the `:` operator; but you can also create vectors of numbers with the `c` function.
- Give `c` all of the numbers that you want to appear in the vector, separated by a comma. `c` stands for **_concatenate_**, but you can think of it as "collect" or "combine"/
