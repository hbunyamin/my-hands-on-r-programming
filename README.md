# My Hands on R programming

This repo contains my learning process through following an excellent online book, [Hands-On Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/) by _Garrett Grolemund_.    

There are also `R Markdown` for learning Bayesian Data Analysis Third Edition!
     
Feel free to enjoy the `R Markdown`s!
